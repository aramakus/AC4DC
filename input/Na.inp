// Average over configuration fractional occupancy is supported, atomic orbital occupancies are between 0 and 4L+2.

#ATOM
11            // Nuclear charge
coulomb      // Nuclear potential model. Can be "coulomb" for point-like nucleus, "sphere" for spherical nucleus.
HF           // Hamiltonian form. Can be HF, LDA.
// Orbitals and their occupancies
4	           // Number of orbitals. Can include virtual orbitals which have occupancy = 0.

2p 6
3s 1
V_N          // Potential model. Can be "V_N" for Hartree-Fock, "V_N-1no" for non-orthogonal excited state orbitals, "V_N-1" for classical potential.
length       // Gauge type for matrix elements involving photon absorption/emission. Can be either "length" or "velocity".

#PULSE
// Parameters for time dynamics. The time interval is fixed and optimized to be 10x the width of the pulse.
8000         // Photon energy in keV.
2            // Pulse width in femtoseconds.
500          // Pulse fluence in 10^4 (J/cm^2).

#NUMERICAL
2000          // Number of grid points
0.001	        // Origin of the coordinate grid. Should be > 0.
100	          // Box radius, maximum distance from the nucleus.
1000          // Initial guess for number of time step points for rate equation. If the value is 0, program skips rate equation soluving step.
7             // Number of threads in OpenMP.
// Hartree-Fock implementation numerical parameters.
-6            // Hartree-Fock tollerance.
-10           // Radial Schroedinger equation solver, tollerance (Master).
-3            // No-exchange step convergence tollerance.
500           // Maximum number of hartree-Fock iterations.

#OUTPUT
500           // Number of time steps in the output files.
Y             // Write charge into a separate file (Y/N)?
Y             // Write intensity into a separate file (Y/N)?
